This is where the region files for ds9 with all the selected galaxies per MUSE field are.  There is a single short jupyter notebook called *create_regions.ipynb* which generates these files using the astropy and the multiprocessing libraries. Centre positions are gathered from the VOtable files in *[outputs/SelectedGals\_sep\_by\_cluster](https://github.com/WilfriedMercier/StageM2/tree/master/outputs/SelectedGals_sep_by_cluster)*.
