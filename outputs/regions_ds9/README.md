This is where the region files used by SAO ds9 software of all the selected galaxies per MUSE field are made.  

Jupyter Notebook *create_regions.ipynb* is used to generate the region files of Selected and Unselected galaxies using the astropy and the multiprocessing libraries. Centre positions are gathered from the VOtable files in *[outputs/SelectedGals\_sep\_by\_cluster](https://github.com/WilfriedMercier/StageM2/tree/master/outputs/SelectedGals_sep_by_cluster)*.
