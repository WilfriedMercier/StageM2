A collection of plots. More specifically:

- IDL\_maps contains the output maps after model fitting constructued with idl
- Selection_\plots gathers plots showing the physical properties of the selected sample for the internship
- absoluteErrorPlots contains old figures plotted at the beginning of the internship in order to understand the origin of the discrepancies in the morphological parameters from different catalogues
- checkMorpho has a couple of plots to show the discrepancy in terms of b/a ratio
- plotsWithColourCoding has similar figures to Selection\_plots but with different data for colour coding
