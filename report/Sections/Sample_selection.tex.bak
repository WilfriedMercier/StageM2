\subsection{COSMOS field}

The point of the analysis is to perform a joint study of the morphology and the kinematics of field galaxies in the COSMOS field using respectively HST ACS images and MUSE data. 

To this end, a set of 9 galaxy groups in the COSMOS field was selected. Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO runs) centred on those groups were performed from which we got 12 different MUSE Fields of View (FoV). The cluster number 32 being larger than the others, three different observations were performed around it with a slight overlapping (mosaic view). The main characteristics of the observed FoVs, including the position of their centre, the average seeing, the total number of galaxies and the number of field galaxies are listed in Table\,\ref{table:MUSEfieldsProp}.

These groups were primarily chosen for their position within the COSMOS field. This ensured them to have a large set of corresponding photometric data available from \shortciteA{laigle2016} catalog for most of the galaxies. Nevertheless, since blind source detections within the data cubes were performed on these FoVs, we should expect a small fraction of galaxies to be detected in MUSE cubes but not in the HST images.\\

Generally speaking, galaxies detected by MUSE are also detected in HST images because of the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) much better resolution (\SI{0.03}{arcsec/px} for HST and $\sim \SI{0.2}{arcsec/px}$ for MUSE). Nevertheless, the MUSE pipeline allows in some cases the detection of sources in regions where there is no HST counterpart. Two sources can even be sperated in areas smaller than the PSF based on their different spectral features, though this happens not often \shortcite{sourceDetectionMUSE}.

\subsection{Prior information on the galaxies}

This intership was planned to be similar in many aspects to what has been doing Epinat B. PhD student Valentina Abridg in LAM, Marseille for her PhD. Her work consisted in studying the morphology and the kinematics of the galaxies within the structures observed by MUSE. The galaxies she was working on were therefore found in the same FoVs but belonged to groups and clusters when those I used were labelled as field galaxies around these structures. 

To differentiate between group and field galaxies, prior to my arrival, a Friend of Friends algorithm (FoF) was run on the galaxies in each FoV in order to seperate them into two categories: group and cluster galaxies.

Additionnaly, GalFit had been run on the cluster galaxies by Valentina and we therefore already had morphological information for them.
Unlike other softwares such as SExtractor or GIM2D which fit a one-component model (Sérsic index as a free parameter) onto photometric images, the morphological model which was used in this case fitted the photometric data with a combination of a disk component (Sérsic index $n=1$) and a spherically symmetric bulge component ($n=4$). 

Hence, we already had the following morphological parameters for the cluster galaxies only: ellipticity and PA (from the disk component), bulge and disk total magnitudes and the half-light radii for both components\footnote{Note this means the value of GalFit half-light radii can be quite different from that given by SExtractor or GIMD2D as shall be discussed in later sections. }


\subsection{Selection criteria}

The total number of galaxies detected with MUSE in the COSMOS field is around $1000$. Roughly half of them belong to clusters and the other half are labelled as field galaxies. Among these galaxies, not all of them are useful to our study. Some may be too close to the edge of detection, others be too noisy with a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), or too small to perform any relevant kinematical modelling. It is thus mandatory to apply a selection on our data set of field galaxies, first to save time on the analysis, but also to reduce errors due to too poor data.

The second point is that we would like to perform a joint study of the morphology and the kinematics of these galaxies. The tools and the models for the kinematical modelling were already developped and are the same as those used by Valentina in her work. On the other hand, fitting morphological models with softwares such as GalFit or SExtractor require some lengthy additionnal time. Hopefully for us, morphological modelling was already performed on the galaxies in the COSMOS field, so we could focus on the kinematical part. 

Morphological information for all galaxies in the COSMOS field can be found in various catalogs\footcite{put site web here}. To start with, we deciced to use the two most complete catalogs we could find, that of Tasca (maybe citation) and Cassata (maybe citation as well). Both catalogs contain morphological information including the central position of the galaxy, its half-light radius, concentration parameter, asymetry, ellipticity, PA, and many more of roughly $232 000$ galaxies. 

To associate the already present data from Laigle+16 within our catalog with theirs, we cross-matched it with each catalog separately and then with both using the right ascension and declination of the centre of the galaxies, allowing for a maximum separation between the MUSE source and the catalogs one of $\SI{1}{arcsec}$ maximum. We should however note that the centre position of the MUSE galaxies correspond to that of the correponding source in Laigle+16 and should therefore be quite close to the value of the cross-matched galaxy since this data comes from Laigle+16 as well.

We performed this cross-matching for both field and cluster galaxies. The utility of cross-matching cluster galaxies when we are only interested in those in the field will be discussed later.
