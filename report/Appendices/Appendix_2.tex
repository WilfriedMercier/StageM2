	\caption[PSF FWHM variation with wavelength.]{PSF $\rm{FWHM}$ variation with wavelength for the 13 FoVs as measured by Valentina. At least two values of the $\rm{FWHM}$ were derived from stars in the MUSE fields by fitting a Gaussian profile onto their light profile. We assumed a linear evolution with wavelength. Strong variations appear depending on the observed field.}
