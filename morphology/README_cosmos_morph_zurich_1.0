% Zurich Structure&Morphology catalog - version v1.0

% This catalog contains the measurements presented in:
%
% 1.  Scarlata, Carollo, Lilly et al 2007, ApJS, 172, 406
%     (i.e., the Zurich Estimator of Structural Type [ZEST] catalog;
%     measurements down to a limiting magnitude of I_AB=24.
%     ZEST measurements for galaxies with half-light radii < 0 .17" are unreliable,
%     especially for galaxies with a steep light profile)
%
% 2.  Sargent, Carollo, Lilly et al 2007, ApJS, 172, 434
%     (i.e., Single-Sersic GIM2D fits;
%     measurements down to a limiting magnitude of I_AB=22.5;
%     formal GIM2D fits are also listed for approx. 2650 compulsory 
%     zCOSMOS-Bright x-ray, radio, etc. sources with I_AB> 22.5 - however,
%     the quality of the fits deteriorates for sources substantially 
%     fainter than ~I_AB~23)
%
% This v1.0 catalog is based on the **May 2006** release 
% of Alexie Leauthaud's ACS catalog (cut at the limits mentioned above)
%
% Notes:
% (a) All ACS_"parameter" columns are copied from the original 
%     May 2006 Leauthaud catalog
% (b) The catalog has been cross-correlated with the 
%     **January 2006** Capak catalog. 
%     All "Capak IDs, RAs, and Decs" refer to this version of 
%     the ground-based photometric catalog, and provide the closest 
%     ground-based match to the ACS source within a radius 
%     of 0.6 arcseconds.
% (c) The catalog contains 71 colums and 131532 lines. Each line is written 
%      in fortran format:  "format(i9,1x,2d23.12,1x,a37,1x,67d23.12)" 
% (d) An entry of -999999 indicates "no measurement" 
%     (including in the ACS and Capak catalogs).
% (e) The pixel scale for the quantities in pixels is 0.03".
